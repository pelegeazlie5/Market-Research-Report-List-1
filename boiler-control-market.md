<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Control Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Modulating Control</li><li>On/Off Control</li><li>High-fire/low-fire Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The boiler control market features three primary types: Modulating Control, On/Off Control, and High-fire/Low-fire Control. Modulating Control allows for continuous adjustment of fuel and air supply, optimizing efficiency and maintaining stable temperature. On/Off Control operates in binary mode, switching the boiler fully on or off, which is simpler but less efficient. High-fire/Low-fire Control uses two distinct firing rates, enabling better efficiency and responsiveness compared to On/Off, while still being less sophisticated than fully modulating systems.</p></p>
